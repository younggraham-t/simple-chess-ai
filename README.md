 AI Search and related classes written by Graham Young
#
This project is a simple implementation of a negamax algorithm to 
search for and play a move in chess

#
To run the project use a Java IDE to run src/chess/Game.java

After running Game.java press the Start button then choose a depth for the AI to search at to start the game.
#
During a game use the Restart button to restart from the standard start position,
use the Forfeit button to forfeit,
and use the undo button to undo a move (undo will undo the last move made by either the player or the AI so use it twice to undo your move)
